# Beanstack Brews
A React.js-based front-end shopping cart designed for the sale of coffee beans. Users can seamlessly add coffee beans to their virtual cart, while the application keeps track of the total cost, the overall quantity of bags selected, and employs efficient state management with Context API for a smooth shopping experience.
